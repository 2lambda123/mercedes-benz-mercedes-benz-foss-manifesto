# How to bring the FOSS Manifesto to your company

If you want to implement a FOSS Manifesto in your company as well, please feel free to use this one right here! If you feel that you don't need to make any changes in terms of content and you fancy a cool design, we have something for you - a customizable old parchment-style PDF! In the unlikely event that you don't like the PDF, you might also take one of the templates in the `templates` folder and replace the placeholders `{company}` and `{the decision takers}`.

There are two ways to create your own FOSS Manifesto: 

**Number 1**

1. Download the PDF [here](https://github.com/mercedes-benz/mercedes-benz-foss-manifesto/blob/main/Your%20FOSS%20Manifesto_parchment-style.pdf)
2. Open it and customize the text within the blue text boxes
3. **Important:** Please save the PDF like this:

	* go to "Print" and then "Print to PDF"
	* now the blue boxes will disappear
	* we put this file under the [**Creative Commons License CC0 1.0**](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/deed.de), so you can use it without restrictions

**Number 2**

Simply copy the Manifesto text from [here](https://github.com/mercedes-benz/mercedes-benz-foss-manifesto/blob/main/mercedes-benz-foss-manifesto.md) (there is a German version [here](https://github.com/mercedes-benz/mercedes-benz-foss-manifesto/blob/main/mercedes-benz-foss-manifesto_de.md)) or from the `templates` folder, either the [english version](templates/template-foss-manifesto.md) or the [german version](templates/template-foss-manifesto_de.md) and customize it as you please.
